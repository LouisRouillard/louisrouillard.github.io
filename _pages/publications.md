## PAVI: Plate-Amortized Variational Inference
*Preprint at TMLR* - 2023-04-18

Through an original combination of amortization and stochastic training, we scale inference to very large problems.

## ADAVI: Automatic Dual Amortized Variational Inference Applied To Pyramidal Bayesian Models
*Published at ICLR 2022* - 2022-04-25

We automatically derive a variational family dual to a plate-enriched Hierarchical Bayesian Network and perform amortized inference.
